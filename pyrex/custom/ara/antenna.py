        Process and store one or more incoming (polarized) signals.

        Processes the incoming signal(s) according to the ``apply_response``
        method, then stores the total processed signal to the signals list. If
        more than one signal is given, they should be logically connected as
        separately polarized portions of the same signal.

        Parameters
        ----------
        signal : Signal or array_like
            Incoming ``Signal`` object(s) to process and store. May be separate
            polarization representations, but therefore should have the same
            times.
        direction : array_like, optional
            Vector denoting the direction of travel of the signal(s) as they
            reach the antenna (in the global coordinate frame). If ``None`` no
            directional gain will be applied.
        polarization : array_like, optional
            Vector(s) denoting the signal's polarization direction (in the
            global coordinate frame). Number of vectors should match the number
            of elements in `signal` argument. If ``None`` no polarization gain
            will be applied.
        force_real : boolean, optional
            Whether or not the frequency response should be redefined in the
            negative-frequency domain to keep the values of the filtered signal
            real.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If the number of polarizations does not match the number of signals.
            Or if the signals do not have the same `times` array.
